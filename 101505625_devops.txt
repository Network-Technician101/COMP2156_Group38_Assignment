The COMP2156 DevOps course is a necessary course, that teaches people how to properly
work on code in groups, in a way that is not only collaborative, but also is very
efficient. And that results in any kind of programming project being not only 
completed quickly, but also fixing bugs and testing applications being quick and 
automated. 

The main tools that the course COMP2156 will teach you, will be how to use git and 
github. These two tools are a big way to maximize efficiency when working on coding
projects in groups. 

The course will also teach you how to implement continuous integration (CI) and 
continuous deployment (CD), and also how to work with cloud infrastructure.
