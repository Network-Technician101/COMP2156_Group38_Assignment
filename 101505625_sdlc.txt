The importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle, is so that people
can properly know how to work efficiently in groups, when it comes to working on 
coding projects. It is also important to know DevOps, because it automates a lot of 
testing and releasing of code, which can save you a lot of time when you are working 
on a project. 

And another reason as to why learning DevOps is important, is because the topic 
teaches you a lot about current technologies that companies use right now. Things
like cloud technology, and various CI tools are things that companies use a lot more 
right now, to help them complete their projects. Those are the main reasons why 
learning DevOps is important in the software development cycle.
